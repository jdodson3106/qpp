## Application Overview
This application is a beta release version of an application that is used for determining which stocks are primed for trading. 
This application is being built for QPP and will be leveraged to as a key component of the organization's trading strategy. The core
algorithm that drives the prediction of the stock price is the backbone of the application.

***This application is not intended for public release and this is simply an example of the beta release for the purposes of showing on my
personal, developer portfolio.***
